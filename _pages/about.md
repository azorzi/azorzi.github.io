I am a doctoral candidate in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department at Stanford University. I am interested in planetary atmospheres, how they are sculpted in the early stages of planet formation and how their physical and chemical state evolves in time. I am also interested in mission formulation and instrumentation, to advance the field of planetary sciences through space exploration.
