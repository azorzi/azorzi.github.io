I am a doctoral candidate in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department at Stanford University. My primary interest is to understand how stochastic, high-energy events perturb planetary systems away from equilibrium, and to resolve these events by developing coupled thermo-chemical models. I have been focusing on planets in their formation and early stages. The research tools I have used to pursue my interest include impact simulations, hydrodynamic modeling, non-equilibrium chemistry in high-temperature gases, radiative transfer modeling, and planetary surface thermal modeling. These tools are highly versatile and applicable to many problems in planetary sciences, and I have used them in various topics.
