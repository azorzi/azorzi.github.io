## Effects of impacts on atmospheres of terrestrial planets

Hypervelocity impacts shock the atmosphere and induce in-situ formation of chemical species. I am interested in modeling the hydrodynamics and kinetics interaction between impact vapor plume and pre-existing atmosphere, to track the production of prebiotic species (HCN, NH$_3$, CH$_4$) and understand the astrobiological potential of impacts on solar and extra solar system rocky worlds.

## Gaseous planet atmospheres



## Thermal evolution of lava worlds

Magma oceans are thought to be an ubiquitous state during planetary accretion, including for our solar system inner planets.

## Planetary formation

## Mission formulation
